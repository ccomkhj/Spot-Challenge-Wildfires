to-do:
build simple model

ways to improve model:
normalization
add "no fire" data to wild fire data
add weather forecast information
add land class information
add Vegetation information

On the first timestep the model has no access to previous steps, and so can't do any better than the simple linear and dense models shown earlier. it should be considered

Normalizing with considering Onehot encoding. (before onehot encoding it shoyld be aplied)

I should develop this model more... - 04.Dec.2020 Huijo

1. Study hard (tzu-chen)
2. maybe no shuffle? (what is the role of shuffle in this code?)
3. output size = 7x28 is correct? 
4. How can you predict depends on date&region (Really Important)
5. shift = 0 is correct?
6. Data normalization (linear & gaussian)
7. use vegetation or land data into Input
8. understand the meaning of plot
