to-do:
build simple model

ways to improve model:
normalization
add "no fire" data to wild fire data
add weather forecast information
add land class information
add Vegetation information

On the first timestep the model has no access to previous steps, and so can't do any better than the simple linear and dense models shown earlier. it should be considered

Normalizing with considering Onehot encoding. (before onehot encoding it shoyld be aplied)

I should develop this model more... - 04.Dec.2020 Huijo

<8.Dec. 2020>
1. Study hard (tzu-chen)
[Done]2. maybe no shuffle? (what is the role of shuffle in this code?)
3. output size = 7x28 is correct? 
4. How can you predict depends on date&region (Really Important)
[Done]5. shift = 0 is correct?
6. Data normalization (linear & gaussian)
7. use vegetation or land data into Input
8. understand the meaning of plot

<9.Dec. 2020>
1. model's not working (always similar values)
2. model validation stop early
3. can't plot after adjusting model output shape
4. is it right to change the last layer dimension as output window size???

<11.Dec.2020 Idea>
1. Using CNN 7x7 input kernel. Then it will cover 7 all regions.
2. Each step, slide 7 rows (not 1)
<Discussed>
1. try different models (cnn) (try with simple data set)
2. merge input data from example ipynb
3. output shape of model (28days * 7regions) 
4. data preprocessing
5. how to artificially create missing data of wildfires

<12.Dec.2020>
"Each step, slide 7 rows" -> therefore I seperated regions for temporary model trying
next step: try encoder/decoder model. Research on how other people deal with seq2seq prediction & missing data

<18. Dec. 2020>
1. Using only partial data (ex. Dec, Jan, Feb)
2. Merging other data (vege, land)
3. When we join data: inner? outer? (if outer, how to treat NaN?)
4. Figuring out how to submit in the competition site + how to produce output as the format of sample submission?
5. When there's missing data in Wildfires, may not because there was no fire, may because we deleted the data due to NaN.


<19. Dec. 2020>
1. dimension redcution PCA
2. when creating training datapoints (31days + 28days), each datapoint only contain one region (continuoes time series)
